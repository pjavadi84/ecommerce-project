### My Ecommerce project

This is an ecommerce application with user authentication built using Node.JS and JavaScript. This project has started as practice project launchpad to practice more on JavaScript and Node.JS concepts. One of the cool thing I have learnt so far with Node is that it is somehow having some similarities with React and obvious differences of their own. But one thing that I found similar is the having an state in which this state can constantly change using events that trigger an actions.

In this app, The very first requirement revolves around user. Once it is verified that the user is already being signed up or logged in, the user presented with getAll method to obtain the repository of products. Each product has an add to cart click event. The cart acts like a state in the React's world, and always something can be added or deleted from this shopping cart object. Each shopping cart should be unqiue and has an ID assigned to it which should belong a unique user.
